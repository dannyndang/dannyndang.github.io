            <p class="portText">
              PhilanthroBot is a Twitter Bot that attempts to maximize the impact of donations by connecting donation doubling opportunities to potential donors. PhilanthroBot was inspired by President Trump's immigration ban and the resulting response of the <a class="aclu" href="https://www.aclu.org/">ACLU</a> and other charitable organizations. Many of these organizations pledged to double donations up to an overall amount (e.g. $50,000), however, many of these amounts were not met. PhilanthroBot attempts to bring awareness to these opportunities, and maximize donations and funding for charitable causes.
              <br>
              <br>
              PhilanthroBot was created for the course Social Computing with the goal of creating a "unique social experience". With a team of four, we used Twitter to conduct user research and piggyback prototype our social experience.

            <h3 class="portSub">Why Twitter?</h3>
            <p class="portText">
              We decided to use Twitter to piggyback prototype our social experience because of its fast consumption nature and accessbility to a wide audience. Tweets are highly visible to all users and remain long after they are made, possibly catching the attention of potential donors. Twitter also enable users to quickly share tweets, allowing our tweets to reach a user's audience. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Twitter also makes it easy to find users that would fit into donation opportunities because of its public profiles, following system, and hashtag system. Below is an example of a potential donor-charity match: an organization is doubling donations towards building homes for homeless pets and a user is shown to follow pro-animal and pro-nature accounts.

              Here is an example tweet that may be sent to connect the user to the charity: </p>

            <h3 class="portSub">Why a Twitter Bot?</h3>
            <p class="portText">
              A Twitter Bot would be ideal because it would operate using a "socially-informed algorithm" to find and match donors to charities. A "socially-informed algorithm" is an algorithm designed and developed dependent of social, cultural, and organizational contexts. By having a Twitter Bot understand these contexts, it would be much more effective in searching for and connecting donor-charity pairs than a human. Unfortunately, due to inexperience and limited time, we were unable to create a fully functioning Twitter Bot. However, we instead relied on the "Wizard of Oz" technique to prototype and test our Twitter social experience.

            <h3 class="portSub">Crafting the Twitter Account</h3>
            <p class="portText">
              To begin, we created and tested three personas for our Twitter account: a normal everyday human account, a bot account, and an organizational account. We wanted to see which of these accounts were perceived to be most trustworthy. We asked peers to comment and rate their opinions and perceived trustworthiness of each account if they were to send them a tweet or message.
              <br>
              <br>
              To our surprise, the bot account was the most trustworthy because it was transparent that it was a Twitter bot and let people know who ran the account. A normal human account made people uncomfortable because they felt like they were being stalked and people were too suspicious of organizations and their ulterior motives to trust the organizational account.

            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="row justify-content-center">
              <img class="bannerFixSmall" src="public/images/nicebottwitter.png">
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="row justify-content-center">
              <img class="bannerFixSmall" src="public/images/orgtwitter.png">
            </div>

            <br>
            <br>
            <p class="portText">
              After finalizing our Twitter persona type, we moved onto handcrafting the tweet language of the account. Because tweets are 140 characters max, we needed to make the most of our word choice. Some of the variations we wanted to test was using direct or indirect language, such as "you" or "everyone", urgency, and donation values. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Based on feedback from peers, using "everyone" or similar indirect language was preferable because it was more comfortable. Using "you" made the user felt guilty and bad about themselves, especially if they were unable to donate. Urgency and donation value did not seem to matter, but our guess to why this was, was because the charities did not follow a current, immediate event. One comment that appealed to many was "Be a mother's hero". We believed this was effective because it was relatable and it gave users a specific demographic to think about and help.
