            <p class="portText">
              Parking has been one of UC San Diego's biggest issues because of its growing student population. With many students living off campus, driving to school has become a necessity. Unfortunately, the number student drivers that need parking greatly outweigh the number of available parking spots. Although simply creating new parking spots is the easiest solution, it is not necessarily possible because of limited campus space available to the school.</p>

            <p class="portText">
               Over the course of 10 weeks, my team and I created and tested various alternative solutions for this campus-wide problem through the course Cognitive Design Studio under the theme of environmental awareness and improvement. We utilized the Double Diamond Design strategy to structure our design process, to understand our audience and problems, and to create a viable solution.

            <h4 class="portText">Exploring Potential Problems</h4>
            <p class="portText">
              Before eventually settling on the the problem of parking, we wanted to find a problem that was not only relevant to the environment, but urgent to the UC San Diego campus. After a rapid-fire discussion, it was clear that transporation was one of the key issues that off-campus students face. We outlined potential problem areas of the process of getting to school and the process of finding parking. We then split our findings into a few affinity diagrams: student needs, limits of alternative travel methods, and parking features.

            </div>


            <h4 class="portText">Needfinding</h4>
            <p class="portText">
              With this information in mind, our team set out for interviews, surveys, and on location observations. For our data collection, we focused on off-campus students and tested ideas on carpooling, autonomous vehicles, alternative transportation, and parking. We also looked into UCSD Housing and Parking statistics to understand the severity of our problem.
            </p>

            <p class="portText">
              Based on UCSD statistics, 17,288 undergraduate students (61 percent of total undergraduate population) live off campus and require a way to get to campus on a daily basis. Additionally, there are only 4,678 parking spots available to undergraduate students. This means 73 percent of the off-campus undergraduate population are left without parking. Data from our surveys also shows that approximately 66 percent of off-campus students own a car and only 57 percent of that population drives to school. We also found that 61 percent of students do not carpool, but 70 percent would like to if there was an easier way to find carpool opportunities. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="portText">
              Comments from interviews and surveys stated that autonomous vehicles would be great because they are efficient and environmentally friendly, but are a solution too far into the future with many moral issues to address. Taking the bus is a popular form of transportation, but students do not like how buses can take upwards of thirty minutes to an hour or require them to switch between multiple bus lines. For many, buses are just too inconvenient and drivers prefer having control over their time. Carpooling was a popular idea, but only if it is convenient, consistent, and safe. Regarding parking, however, an improvement of any kind would be welcome with open arms. 
            </p>

            <br>

            <h4 class="portText" style="margin-bottom: 25px;">The Problem to Solve: Parking</h4>
            
            <div class="row justify-content-center">
            
              <img class="bannerFixfb" src="public/images/parkinglot.png">
              
            </div>

            <p class="portText">
              Ultimately, we decided that tackling the parking situation would be the best course of action. Almost everyone we interviewed and surveyed stated that the parking situation could be better. Data from the survey also showed that finding parking took an average of 20 to 30 minutes. Based on observations of parking lots across campus, we noticed that many drivers spent excessive amounts of time circling and waiting in parking lots hoping for a parking spot to open up. </p> 

            <p class="portText">
              Students thought this was not only a waste of time, but a waste of gas and money. From the perspective of students, they would rather spend this valuable time studying, hanging out with friends, or on more important activities. Additionally, the unnecessary amount of gas expended creates harmful emissions and causes students to pay more for gas over time. With time and money being two very valuable and limited resources for students, unnecessary spending of these may increase stress in students. With our problem made clear, we set our minds on the second phase of the design process: creating the solution. 
            </p>

            <p class="portText">Here is a video visualizing our problem:</p>

            <h3 class="portSub">Phase 2: Create</h3>
            <br>
            <h4 class="portText">Prototype Ideas</h4>

            <p class="portText">
              To  begin developing our solution, our team split up to individually come with up potential solutions. We wanted to maximize the amount of unique ideas that we could come up with to then pooled the ideas together for discussion. Some of our ideas included:  
            </p>

            <ul type="square" class="portText">
              <li>Parking Availability Sign</li>
              <li>Facebook Carpool & Rideshare Group</li>
              <li>Valet System</li>
              <li>Real time cameras broadcasting parking lot status</li>
              <li>Automated/Puzzle Parking Structures</li>
              <li>Open Parking Spot Availibity Notifier</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="portText">
              Out of these six ideas, we had to exclude the valet system, real time cameras, and parking structure designs because it was out of our scope to test these ideas. A valet system would improve the flow of a parking lot and provides students with on-campus job opportunities, however, it runs into the issue of trust and whether or not the school wants to provide the service. Real time cameras would allow students to gauge the status of the parking lot online before commiting to trying to find parking, but setting up cameras to test was beyond our resources. Parking structure designs are ideal because it would utilize vertical space to create more parking spaces, but once again, it is impossible to test physically. 
            </p>

            <p class="portText">Examples of parking structure designs we were considering:</p>

            <div class="row justify-content-center">
            
              <img class="bannerFixfb" src="public/images/parkstructure.png">
              
            </div>
            
            <p class="portText">
              Of the three remaining ideas, we believed both a parking availability sign and an open parking spot notification system would be the most effective solution. Surprisingly, most of the parking lots that were available to students did not have either of these features. It was no surprise that students would welcome any solution with open arms. Lastly, we wanted to test a carpooling resouce as our survey showed that was a large demand for it. Carpooling would theoretically reduce the amount of cars on the road and subsequently the number of drivers that need to find parking, making it a possible parking improvement. 
            </p>

            <br>
            <h4 class="portText">Creating Prototypes</h4>

            <p class="portText">
              Our first prototype was a simple, barebone parking availability sign. We wanted to collect people's opinions on this type of sign as well as see if it had the ability to influence someone's decision and course of action. 
            </p>


            <div class="row justify-content-center">
            
              <img class="bannerFixfb" src="public/images/yesparking.jpeg">
              <img class="bannerFixfb" src="public/images/noparking.png">
              
            </div>

            <p class="portText">
              Our second prototype was an open parking spot notifier. Many parking structures had green or red lights above parking spots to signify an open or taken spot, however, because we planned on testing on an open lot, we wanted to create an alternative version of this system. Our variation was a device that would hover or sit above an open parking spot. A car would then drive into the spot and push the device down, signifying that the spot was taken. This solution would make it easier for drivers to find open spots from a large distance away. 
            </p>


            <div class="row justify-content-center">
              <img class="bannerFixfb" src="public/images/parknotif.PNG">
            </div>


            <p class="portText">
              Our final and third prototype was to create a carpool group through Facebook. Facebook rideshare groups have been very popular in helping people find rides from place to place, but have been mostly for longer distance trips. We wanted to know if a carpool variation would work. We decided to gauge interest by posting an ad on a UCSD Free for Sale page and seeing if anyone would sign up to carpool.
