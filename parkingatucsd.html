            <p class="portText">
              Parking has been one of UC San Diego's biggest issues because of its growing student population. With many students living off campus, driving to school has become a necessity. Unfortunately, the number student drivers that need parking greatly outweigh the number of available parking spots. Although simply creating new parking spots is the easiest solution, it is not necessarily possible because of limited campus space available to the school.</p>

            <p class="portText">
               Over the course of 10 weeks, my team and I created and tested various alternative solutions for this campus-wide problem through the course Cognitive Design Studio under the theme of environmental awareness and improvement. We utilized the Double Diamond Design strategy to structure our design process, to understand our audience and problems, and to create a viable solution.

            <h4 class="portText">Exploring Potential Problems</h4>
            <p class="portText">
              Before eventually settling on the the problem of parking, we wanted to find a problem that was not only relevant to the environment, but urgent to the UC San Diego campus. After a rapid-fire discussion, it was clear that transporation was one of the key issues that off-campus students face. We outlined potential problem areas of the process of getting to school and the process of finding parking. We then split our findings into a few affinity diagrams: student needs, limits of alternative travel methods, and parking features. 
            </p>

            </div>


            <h4 class="portText">Needfinding</h4>
            <p class="portText">
              With this information in mind, our team set out for interviews, surveys, and on location observations. For our data collection, we focused on off-campus students and tested ideas on carpooling, autonomous vehicles, alternative transportation, and parking. We also looked into UCSD Housing and Parking statistics to understand the severity of our problem.
            </p>

            <p class="portText">
              Based on UCSD statistics, 17,288 undergraduate students (61 percent of total undergraduate population) live off campus and require a way to get to campus on a daily basis. Additionally, there are only 4,678 parking spots available to undergraduate students. This means 73 percent of the off-campus undergraduate population are left without parking. Data from our surveys also shows that approximately 66 percent of off-campus students own a car and only 57 percent of that population drives to school. We also found that 61 percent of students do not carpool, but 70 percent would like to if there was an easier way to find carpool opportunities. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="portText">
              Comments from interviews and surveys stated that autonomous vehicles would be great because they are efficient and environmentally friendly, but are a solution too far into the future with many moral issues to address. Taking the bus is a popular form of transportation, but students do not like how buses can take upwards of thirty minutes to an hour or require them to switch between multiple bus lines. For many, buses are just too inconvenient and drivers prefer having control over their time. Carpooling was a popular idea, but only if it is convenient, consistent, and safe. Regarding parking, however, an improvement of any kind would be welcome with open arms. 
            </p>

            <br>

            <h4 class="portText" style="margin-bottom: 25px;">The Problem to Solve: Parking</h4>
            
            <div class="row justify-content-center">
            
              <img class="bannerFixfb" src="public/images/parkinglot.png">
              
            </div>

            <p class="portText">
              Ultimately, we decided that tackling the parking situation would be the best course of action. Almost everyone we interviewed and surveyed stated that the parking situation could be better. Data from the survey also showed that finding parking took an average of 20 to 30 minutes. Based on observations of parking lots across campus, we noticed that many drivers spent excessive amounts of time circling and waiting in parking lots hoping for a parking spot to open up. </p> 

            <p class="portText">
              Students thought this was not only a waste of time, but a waste of gas and money. From the perspective of students, they would rather spend this valuable time studying, hanging out with friends, or on more important activities. Additionally, the unnecessary amount of gas expended creates harmful emissions and causes students to pay more for gas over time. With time and money being two very valuable and limited resources for students, unnecessary spending of these may increase stress in students. With our problem made clear, we set our minds on the second phase of the design process: creating the solution. 
            </p>

            <p class="portText">Here is a video visualizing our problem:</p>

            <div class="videoWrapper">

            <h3 class="portSub">Phase 2: Create</h3>
            <br>
            <h4 class="portText">Prototype Ideas</h4>

            <p class="portText">
              To  begin developing our solution, our team split up to individually come with up potential solutions. We wanted to maximize the amount of unique ideas that we could come up with to then pooled the ideas together for discussion. Some of our ideas included:  
            </p>

            <ul type="square" class="portText">
              <li>Parking Availability Sign</li>
              <li>Facebook Carpool & Rideshare Group</li>
              <li>Valet System</li>
              <li>Real time cameras broadcasting parking lot status</li>
              <li>Automated/Puzzle Parking Structures</li>
              <li>Open Parking Spot Availability Notifier</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="portText">
              Out of these six ideas, we had to exclude the valet system, real time cameras, and parking structure designs because it was out of our scope to test these ideas. A valet system would improve the flow of a parking lot and provides students with on-campus job opportunities, however, it runs into the issue of trust and whether or not the school wants to provide the service. Real time cameras would allow students to gauge the status of the parking lot online before commiting to trying to find parking, but setting up cameras to test was beyond our resources. Parking structure designs are ideal because it would utilize vertical space to create more parking spaces, but once again, it is impossible to test physically. 
            </p>

            <p class="portText">Examples of parking structure designs we were considering:</p>

            <div class="row justify-content-center">
            
              <img class="bannerFixfb" src="public/images/parkstructure.png">
              
            </div>
            
            <p class="portText">
              Of the three remaining ideas, we believed both a parking availability sign and an open parking spot notification system would be the most effective solution. Surprisingly, most of the parking lots that were available to students did not have either of these features. It was no surprise that students would welcome any solution with open arms. Lastly, we wanted to test a carpooling resouce as our survey showed that was a large demand for it. Carpooling would theoretically reduce the amount of cars on the road and subsequently the number of drivers that need to find parking, making it a possible parking improvement. 
            </p>

            <br>
            <h4 class="portText">Creating & Testing Initial Prototypes</h4>
            <h5 class="portText">1. Parking Availability Sign</h5>
            <p class="portText">
              Our first prototype was a simple, barebone parking availability sign. We wanted to collect people's opinions on this type of sign as well as see if it had the ability to influence someone's decision and course of action. 
            </p>


            <div class="row justify-content-center">
            
              <img class="bannerFixfb" src="public/images/yesparking.jpeg">
              <img class="bannerFixfb" src="public/images/noparking.png">
              
            </div>


            <p class="portText">
              We began testing by collecting feedback from peers and student drivers and their replies were as expected:
            </p>

            <ul type="square" class="portText">
              <li>"Wow, I just realized UCSD doesn't actually have this sort of sign."</li>
              <li>"It looks terrible, but I think would be pretty good for parking lots."</li>
              <li>"If this sign was legit, I would probably use it to decide whether or not go into a parking lot."</li>
              <li>"UCSD doesn't have this kind of sign yet?"</li>
              <li>"I don't think I would notice or be able to read this sign from a distance if I was driving, maybe you should make it prettier and easier to read before testing at parking lots."</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="portText">
              Although we were expecting positive responses, it was reassuring that the people we tested on shared these responses. It was nearly unanimous that a parking sign would help, as long as we improved our sign before testing it at parking lots.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h5 class="portText">2. Open Parking Spot Availability Notifier</h5>
            <p class="portText">
              Our second prototype was an open parking spot notifier. Many parking structures had green or red lights above parking spots to signify an open or taken spot, however, because we planned on testing on an open lot, we wanted to create an alternative version of this system. Our variation was a device that would hover or sit above an open parking spot. A car would then drive into the spot and push the device down, signifying that the spot was taken. This solution would make it easier for drivers to find open spots from a large distance away. 
            </p>


            <div class="row justify-content-center">
              <img class="bannerFixfb" src="public/images/parknotif.png">
            </div>

            <p class="portText">
              For this prototype, we had people test the sequence of the experience. We had people take our toy car and drive it onto a parking spot in which it pushed down our "device", in this case, a straw. Some insights we had were:
            </p>

            <ul type="square" class="portText">
              <li>People needed instructions, otherwise they would not know what to do.</li>
              <li>Once demonstrated, the prototype made complete sense to everyone watching.</li>
              <li>Idea was well liked, but people wondered how we would manage to test in a real parking lot.</li>
              <li>People argued that parking lots are going to be full anyways, and if all spots are taken, it wouldn't help people know that there's no open parking spots.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="portText">
              Because UC San Diego parking lots will almost always be packed, we decided not to follow on with this prototype until we figured out a way to show people parking availability (our first prototype). We were planning on testing with balloons at parking lots, but because people were already confused from our prototype, we were thinking of prototyping a different system instead. 
            </p>


            <br>

            <h5 class="portText">3. Facebook Carpooling Group</h5>
            <p class="portText">
              Our third and final prototype was to create Facebook carpooling group. Facebook rideshare groups have been very popular in helping people find rides from place to place, but have been mostly used for longer distance trips. We wanted to know if a carpool variation would work. We decided to gauge interest by posting an ads across various UCSD Facebook pages and seeing if anyone would sign up to carpool.
            </p>

            <div class="row justify-content-center">
              <img class="bannerFixSmall" src="public/images/fbproto.png">
            </div>

            <br>

            <p class="portText">
              The Facebook posts included a sign up form and a survey for those who wanted to give feedback for a carpool group. We had around 20 to 30 likes per post and positive comments overall. Our survey found that over 70% of the people wanted to carpool if they had a way to organize it. Despite the positive feedback, only two people signed up to carpool. Because of the low number of people actually signing up, we decided that it would not be worth testing because it would yield insufficient data. Because the post went up in the later half of the school's quarter, we believed people were already committed to a commuting method and did not want to try something different. 
            </p>


            <br>
            <h4 class="portText">Prototype of Choice: Parking Availability Sign</h4>

            <br>

            <div class="row justify-content-center">
              <img class="bannerFixfb" src="public/images/proto2.png">
            </div>

            <p class="portText">
              Before testing in parking lots, we updated our parking availability sign prototype to be easier to read and visible from across the street. We included S and B parking spots, which are spots designated for undergraduate students along how many parking spots for each type of spot were still available. We also created a sequence model, in which we mapped out the ideal steps of finding parking if a parking availability sign were to be installed. 
            </p>

            <div class="row justify-content-center">
              <img class="bannerFixfb" src="public/images/parkseq.png">
            </div>
            

            <p class="portText">
              To test our prototype, we headed to Muir Parking Lot, the most popular parking lot on the UC San Diego campus for undergraduates. The parking lot is popular because its conveniently placed in the center of campus, and as a result, always has high activity thoughout the day. Additionally, it only has one entrance and exit, making it the perfect place to test our prototype. 

              <br>
              <br>
              We stood at the entrance of the parking lot with the sign in hand and recorded how people reacted to it. We tested this sign at different times throughout the day, and by standing at different parts of the entrance. We also manipulated the numbers on our prototype to see how people would react to an full versus a parking lot with a few open spots.

            </p>

            </div>

            <p class="portText"> Overall, our testing produced solid results and that our prototype worked. Our findings include:</p>

            <ul type="square" class="portText">
              <li>62% of drivers saw, but ignored the sign.</li>
              <li>13% of drivers showed considerable hesitation in whether or not to turn into the parking lot or not. </li>
              <li>24% of drivers trusted the sign and left for a different parking.</li>

              It was clear from our results that our prototype was successful and that people wanted some sort of parking availability sign. We then proceded to develop our final prototype.

              For our final prototype, we improved the content of the sign and made it easier to read. Parking Available as the header makes it more clear for drivers to see what the sign is trying to convey. S and B spots are now the color of their respective parking spots and we added a "Cars Waiting" column because many drivers that we observed were willing to wait in a full lot for parking to open up. We also considered that if our prototype were to be implemented, the most accurate way to track information is to have it automated and electronic. To emulate this, we opened our phones to Google Docs and changed the numbers real time as cars enter and leave the parking lot.

              We quickly took our final prototype back to Muir Parking Lot for last minute testing and definitely had better results than our previous prototype. Much more people were willing to use the sign to decide whether or not to turn into the parking lot and many appreciated that we were saving their time. With our final prototype completed, we decided to make a quick return to our second initial prototype idea: an open parking spot notification system.

              Because our parking availability sign solved the problem of knowing whether or not there is parking spots available in a parking lot, we can work on a system that helps drivers find these open spots. As seen in the image above, instead of having many devices that rise and fall as vehicles park in them, we decided to have two electronic signs attached to a light pole showing the amount of open spots in each lane. This theoretical system would require significantly less resources than devices for each parking spot and would update through sensors. By looking at the top of each row of parking, drivers can see which row to enter instead of driving through the entire lot to find a parking spot. The parking availability sign and notification system would work hand in hand using sensors to correctly convey information to drivers seeking parking.

              Below is a video visualizing our solution. The driver sees that there are available parking spots using our parking availability sign and turns into the parking lot. The driver then looks for the row with an open parking spot via the notification system and finds a parking spot accordingly.

            <p class="portText">
              Overall, I believe we created an excellent solution for UC San Diego's parking problem by giving drivers the ability to make better decisions on whether or not to park at specific parking lot. I believe we collected excellent user research and made the appropriate decisions to create our solution. Thank you for reading and please contact me if you have any questions!
