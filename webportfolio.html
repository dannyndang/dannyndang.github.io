            <p class="portText">
              As an aspiring designer, I believe it is a necessity to have a solid web portfolio. I want to show off the work I've accomplished and impress those who view my portfolio. I also strived to make a portfolio that gave a good representation of my personality. 
            </p>

            <p class="portText">
              One handicap I decided to give myself was to not use a template. I wasn't satisfied with my current ability to code in HTML and CSS and wanted to use this opportunity to learn and code from scratch. I wanted to fully understand Bootstrap, CSS libraries, and responsive design and put myself under a bootcamp-like learning experience.

          <h3 class="portSub ">Competitive Analysis</h3>
            <p class="portText">
               I began my process by collecting around 20 web portfolios between my friends, peers, and online browsing. After narrowing them down, it seemed that many portfolios followed the layout of:
            </p>

            <ul type="square" class="portText">
              <li>Always present global navigation bar</li>
              <li>Hero Section</li>
              <li>About Me Section</li>
              <li>Summary of Education, Skills, Tools</li>
              <li>Portfolio Gallery</li>
              <li>Contact Form</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="portText">
               From this point, I had a question for myself: do I follow the norm or do I try something different? My initial impression of the layout was that it looked great. It was visually attractive and was effective at representing the personality of the individual. The layout is also widely used for start ups, small businesses, and services. If this layout was not effective, why would it be so widely used? I decided it was best to follow the norm and began with a rough mockup.

            </div>

            <p class="portText">
               Using Balsamiq, I created a rough mockup of my layout of choice to use as reference. I decided to keep it simple and code top down, following my mockup. I made sure to only focus on functionality, and to only address aesthetics and style (color scheme, image choice, typography) after my functionality is completely finished.

              <br>

              <p class="portText">
                I created a global navigation bar that is always present, made the navbar mobile responsive, and added a highlighting feature to help users know where they are in my portfolio.
              </p>


            <h5 class="portSub ">2. Hero Section</h5>
              <div class="row justify-content-center">
                  <img class="bannerFixfb" src="public/images/heropar.png">
              </div>

              <p class="portText">
                For my hero section, I decided to have it expand to my entire window to give emphasis on my name and title. I also had my text fade in to give a dynamic effect. Hero sections are like opening credits, and it needs to give a good first impression.
              </p>


            <h5 class="portSub ">3. About Me</h5>
              <div class="row justify-content-center">
                  <img class="bannerFixfb" src="public/images/oldaboutme.png">
              </div>


              <p class="portText">
                I originally included a picture of myself in the About Me section, but found that the image made the screen feel unbalanced. I opted for short and simple text and a link to my resume instead.   
              </p>


            <h5 class="portSub ">4. Portfolio Gallery</h5>
              <div class="row justify-content-center">
                  <img class="bannerFixfb" src="public/images/portgal.png">
              </div>


              <p class="portText">
                The portfolio gallery is probably the most interesting section to make because of the many ways you could display portfolio items. Did I want cards, expanding items, simple pictures, or other cool animations? 
              </p>

              <p class="portText">
                 One thing I knew for sure was that I wanted a way to highlight the item a user is viewing and ultimately decided expand-on-hover would be a fun feature. I also wanted my items to be symmetrical and opted for rows of three squares. Lastly, I created temporary images to fill in the gallery for future testing.  
              </p>
            

          </div>

          <div class="col-xl-5">
            <h3 class="portSub">Early Reflection & User Testing</h3>
            
            <p class="portText">
               First and foremost, I was happy with the improvement of my HTML/CSS abilities. Using and applying Bootstrap and other CSS libraries while making things responsive became seamless actions. The only hiccup was getting the portfolio gallery to be responsive and interactive at the same time and that took many attempts of trial and error until I figured it out. 
               <br>
               <br>
               Secondly, after finishing the first iteration, I did not feel confident in the layout. Although a popular layout to use, it ultimately felt like I was hiding behind my hero and about me sections by presenting them before my portfolio gallery. The layout felt more like tell and then show rather than show, don't tell. I wanted my portfolio to be more proactive.
               <br>
               <br>
               To test my opinions, I asked my friends and peers to evaluate my portfolio. I made sure to include to have people of varying backgrounds to get the best feedback possible. Here's the feedback I received:
            </p>

            <ul type="square" class="portText">
              <li>Hero section looks nice, but ultimately does not add much to the portfolio.</li>
              <li>About Me section is fine as its a necessity to have somewhere in the portfolio.</li>
              <li>Portfolio gallery could have more emphasis.</li>
              <li>"I care more about your portfolio items than your about me section or the hero section."</li>
              <li>Portfolio gallery looks terrible on mobile.</li>
              <li>Layout looks good, up to you if you want to change it.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="portText">
              It seems that although the layout is popular and looks good, it presents the viewers with a lot of information they do not care about. At the same time, the layout is passable, and is ultimately up to me if I want to change my layout. With that in mind, I decided that changing my layout would make me happier.

            </div>

            <p class="portText">
              With my decision to start over from scratch using a different layout, I created a new mock up with a few key things in mind:
            </p>
            
            <ul type="square" class="portText">
              <li>Portfolio items will be the emphasis of my home page.</li>
              <li>Remove the hero section.</li>
              <li>Move the about me section to a different page.</li>
            </ul>
            
             <p class="portText">
              I believe these key changes would better represent myself and my pesonality. I want to show off my portfolio items, and this will be the best way to do it.

          </div>

            <h5 class="portSub">1. Global Navigation</h5>
              <div class="row justify-content-center">
                    <img class="bannerFix" src="public/images/ddheader.png">
              </div>

            <p class="portText">After comparing different navbars from various portfolios, I decided to go with an unconventional, centered navbar. I noticed that a conventional fixed navbar looks fantastic if one has a logo, but leaves something to be desired if one just used their name. Because I do not currently have a logo, a centered header with my name and title would better emphasize myself and navigation would fit nicely with it. I do plan on crafting a logo in the future and will most likely change to a conventional fixed navbar. </p>

            <h5 class="portSub">2. Portfolio Gallery</h5>
              <div class="row justify-content-center">
                    <img class="bannerFixfb" src="public/images/pogal.png">
              </div>

            <p class="portText">
              Based on feedback and my preferences, I decided to make each portfolio item fit one full screen to maximize emphasis. People wanted more information on each project, so I added short project descriptions. Portfolio items also alternate in a left right pattern to give the page more balance and flair.
            </p>

            <h5 class="portSub">3. About Me Page</h5>
              <div class="row justify-content-center">
                    <img class="bannerFixfb" src="public/images/aboutmehey.png">
              </div>

            <p class="portText">
              By removing the about me section to its own page, I freed up space for my portfolio items and was able to expand on about me information. I was able to add relevant social media links and contact information. 
            </p>

            <h5 class="portSub">4. Portfolio Pages</h5>

              </div>

            <p class="portText">
              Lastly, I wanted to make sure I had a consistent layout between each project article and came up with this general layout. The project title is followed by image, if available, background description, and an overview that goes over my role, time spent, skills, tools, and deliverables applicable with current project. The remaining page is split by headers, sub headers, text, and images as necessary.

            <p class="portText">
              The three adjectives I wanted to go for was minimalistic, professional, and sleek. The simple page elements and color will make my portfolio accessible to many devices. Being minimalistic will also help people navigate around my portfolio better. White space will make it easier to read, while also providing emphasis to important items on the page. Being professional is given and sleek is to show that I can be quick and effective. However, because I have a very "show, don't tell" portfolio, I may miss out on other personality traits that would make me appear fun and someone people would like to work with. I will be looking for ways to improve my portfolio in that regard.

            <br>

            <p class="portText">
              For my color choice, I kept it simple with white and a light grey. These two colors are commonly used in other minimalistic style websites. My third color, lavendar, functions as an accent color. Although it is definitely not the most visible color, my friends associate me with this color and therefore I think its fitting as my accent color. I use different levels of opacity of lavendar throughout my portfolio to add a bit more character to it.
            </p>
            <p class="portText">
              For my font choice, I initially wanted a serif font for a header and a sans-serif font for body text. However, I believe two sans-serif fonts would be more fitting for a modern and sleek portfolio. I decided on Montserrat to be my header font as I find it to be strong and stylistic and Hind to be my body font to contrast Montserrat and be simple to read.

            <p class="portText">
              Although I'm happy with my portfolio, I still think I have much to learn and improve on. My HTML/CSS ability definitely improved, but there are still many tricks I still want to learn. Responsive design is also tricky and I still need to iron the kinks out for my portfolio. Regardless, I've set up a solid base for me to develop in HTML/CSS.
